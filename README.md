# Jeopardy

## About
This is my first large project here at General Assembly.
The game has several categories with buttons under them with varying point values.
User will challenge themselves on different categories with progressively harder questions.

## Rules
Users will have one chance to answer correctly on the selected category and value.  
If the user answers correctly, the value will be added to their score, if not, nothing will be added, then that button will no longer be available to be clicked.
If you wish to start over, click the restart button.
